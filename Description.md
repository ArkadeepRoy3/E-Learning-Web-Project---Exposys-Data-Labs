The E-Learning Web Project was developed during my final year of engineering as part of my curriculum, under the guidance of Exposys Data Labs, a software company.

This E-Learning web application allows learners to engage in interactive activities such as taking tests, submitting responses, presenting seminars, and more. It provides students and teachers with a real-time learning environment without the need to be physically present in a school space.

Language used : HTML5, CSS, JS, PHP.

Tools used : Sublime Text, XAMPP.
